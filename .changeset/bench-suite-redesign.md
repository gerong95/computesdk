Redesign `@computesdk/bench` with a suite-based API and move benchmark recording into the bench package.

**`@computesdk/bench` (breaking)**
- Replace single-shot `bench.run(operation, fn, options)` with a suite API: `bench.add(name, fn)` + `bench.run(options)`
- `createBench()` now requires a `label` field — the human-readable suite name used as the primary grouping key in benchmark events
- Task functions receive a `BenchContext` (`ctx.iteration`, `ctx.phase`, `ctx.taskName`, `ctx.log(...)`) instead of a bare iteration index
- `ctx.log()` entries are attached as redacted `logs[]` on the benchmark span for that iteration
- Remove `sdkVersion` from `BenchConfig` — version is now auto-detected via build-time injection
- Add optional `apiUrl` / `apiKey` on `BenchConfig`; when omitted, events are local-only via `onEvent`
- Upload benchmark events in background batches with a bounded queue and best-effort final flush
- Add optional `groupId` and `shard` metadata for multi-process/sharded benchmark runs
- Add optional `captureOutput.file` / `captureOutput.flushInterval` to emit tailed process output as `benchmark.output` events
- Return type changes from `BenchResult` to `BenchSuiteResult` with per-task stats

**`@computesdk/bench` benchmark primitives**
- Add `BenchSuiteEvent` (`benchmark.suite`) emitted once per `bench.run()` with label, task names, provider, iterations, and warmup
- Add `BenchEvent`, `BenchSpanEvent`, `BenchOutputEvent`, and `BenchAttempt` types
- Add shared benchmark helpers for IDs, runtime detection, error codes, and event emission
- Print a Tinybench-style summary table to stdout after `bench.run()` completes

**`computesdk` (patch)**
- Remove the experimental automatic telemetry configuration/export surface while bench is redesigned independently
